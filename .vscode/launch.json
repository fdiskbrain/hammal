You can also set this to null or an empty array, but source maps in node_modules might get evaluated which may slow you down significantly unless you specifically want to debug those. NOTE: The latest non-released build of wrangler as of 2023-10-15 moves the temp files to the .wrangler folder in your workspace dir, so this is no longer needed as it is automatically detected correctly.
